# Python-Art

This is a repo for what will hopefully be a collection of Python scripts that create various types of art through image
manipulation. This project is to specifically learn more about Python itself and libraries such as Pillow. 

The current script I am working on draws significant inspiration from Quads: https://github.com/fogleman/Quads
